# PlotTA
This is an assignment set up by one of my interviewing company. It aims at creating an R package for the plots used in technical analysis.

## Usage
- clone the project
- install the packages in R (in terminal it is "R CMD INSTALL PlotTA_0.1.0.tar.gz")
- run the example.R for exploration!
